# auto-android
This repository contains scripts that allow you to automatically download an app from the Google Play Store onto your connected Android device using ADB. Once the app is downloaded, the scripts will automatically extract/pull the app from your Android device onto your PC.

The scripts are written in JavaScript or Python (if I get lazy) and can be run on any operating system that supports ADB. They are designed to be easy to use and require (almost) no programming experience.

To use the scripts, simply connect your Android device to your PC using a USB cable and run the appropriate script. The script will automatically download the app from the Google Play Store and extract/pull it onto your PC.
